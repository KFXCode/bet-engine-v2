run_daily.py -- the one command you run each day.

MLB IS MONEYLINE-ONLY. HR props are retired (11-120, ROI -46% over 131
graded picks). Everything HR-related is stripped from generation and records.

NFL RUNS TWO SEPARATE PROP BOARDS, ranked and capped INDEPENDENTLY:
  - anytime touchdown            (engine/td_props.py)      cap 10
  - yards / receptions / pass TD (engine/player_props.py)   cap 10
Both caps are ceilings, not quotas: a thin slate publishing four is correct.

DEPTH FILTERING (Sep 14, 2026) -- the backup-QB bug. data/nfl_players.
filter_to_contributors cuts each roster to one QB plus players clearing
per-position volume floors, BEFORE either board is built.

CLOSING LINES (Oct 5, 2026): the hourly checks that used to stop at the
auto-gate now call data/closing_lines.capture_closing_lines, which takes one
fresh price on each picked game shortly before it starts. That gives every
pick a real closing line, so the overnight grader's CLV is real instead of
"same price as publish." History then marks each graded moneyline with
↑ (line moved your way) or ↓ (moved against you). No new workflows.
