        THE DATE BUG THIS FIXES (Sep 14, 2026) -- it stranded 41 NFL picks.

        Two compounding mistakes lived here:

        1. `game.date` is the date of the RUN that discovered the game, not
           the date the game is played. ESPN's scoreboard for a given day
           happily returns neighbouring games, so Saturday's run pulled the
           whole Sunday NFL slate and stamped all 14 games '2026-09-12'.

        2. The ON CONFLICT clause refreshed the pitchers and the kickoff time
           but NOT the date -- so once a game was stored wrong, every later
           run left the wrong date in place permanently.

        Grading matches non-MLB results on date + teams, so every Sunday NFL
        pick asked ESPN for Saturday's scoreboard, got nothing final back, and
        sat 'pending' forever. Results were available the whole time; the
        lookup was just asking about the wrong day. Nothing errored.

        The kickoff timestamp already carries the true answer, so the stored
        date is now DERIVED from game_time_utc (converted to config.TIMEZONE)
        and only falls back to the run date when a game has no time yet. The
        conflict clause refreshes it too, which means existing wrong rows
        self-heal the next time that game appears on a slate."""
