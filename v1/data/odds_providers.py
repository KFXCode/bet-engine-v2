"""
data/odds_providers.py
=======================
Moneyline/total odds. Two implementations behind one interface:

- MockOddsProvider   : deterministic synthetic odds. LOCAL DEV ONLY.
- TheOddsApiProvider : real odds from https://the-odds-api.com, FanDuel book.

NO FABRICATED PRICES IN API MODE (Sep 4, 2026). This used to substitute
MockOddsProvider for any game the live feed didn't return -- inventing a price
and then grading a real pick against it. That is the worst possible failure
mode: it produced a board of +563/+421/+321 "opportunities" that never existed,
and three NCAAF totals were "won" off fabricated baseball-shaped lines. It also
made the report warn that credits were exhausted when they weren't (287 of
20,000 used) -- because the warning inferred the cause instead of reporting it.

The order is now: LIVE price -> last REAL price we stored for that game -> no
pick at all. A game with no real price is simply left out of the slate. Fewer
picks on a thin day is strictly better than confident picks at invented odds.

The stored-price fallback matters mid-day: once a game starts it drops out of
the live feed, and without it every in-progress game would vanish from the
board along with the picks already published on it.

CREDIT DISCIPLINE:
1. MARKETS: The Odds API bills PER MARKET. We ask only for what each sport's
   model actually consumes (MARKETS_BY_SPORT) -- asking for h2h,spreads,totals
   everywhere was paying 3 credits for 1 credit of use.
2. CACHE: responses are cached 4h, so re-runs inside a window cost nothing.
3. FLOOR: paid calls stop while a reserve remains, and remaining credits are
   recorded so the report can state the true number instead of guessing.
