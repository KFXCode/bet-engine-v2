data/espn_fetch.py
===================
Resilient ESPN scoreboard fetch, shared by every ESPN-based schedule provider.

WHY (Aug 24, 2026): WNBA and NFL tabs vanished from the report. The chain was:
ESPN's site.api host returns nothing from GitHub Actions' datacenter IPs, so
the provider fell through to The Odds API -- and once the paid Odds API credits
ran out, there was NO schedule at all, so no games, so no tab.

The fix: ESPN publishes the SAME scoreboard on several hosts. All three of
these were verified returning identical data (same event ids) for the same
date:
    site.api.espn.com      (the original)
    site.web.api.espn.com  (alternate API host)
    cdn.espn.com/core/...  (CDN, different infrastructure entirely)

A block on one host is very unlikely to hit all three, so we try them in
order and return the first that yields events. This keeps schedules FREE
(no Odds API credits burned just to learn what games exist) and keeps the
Odds API purely as a last-resort fallback.

Note the CDN host nests its payload differently:
    site hosts -> {"events": [...]}
    cdn core   -> {"content": {"sbData": {"events": [...]}}}
Both shapes are unwrapped here so callers always just get a list of events.

=====================================================================
DATE FILTER (Oct 9, 2026) -- the "9-0 on a Tuesday" bug.
=====================================================================
On a day with no games for a league, ESPN does NOT return an empty board. It
quietly falls back to the CURRENT WEEK's games. The Oct 6 run (a Tuesday) asked
for that day's NFL slate, got Sunday and Monday's already-finished games back,
picked them as if they were upcoming, and graded them on the spot. The player
stats feeding the picks already included those games, so it "picked" players
who had already scored and went a perfect 9-0 on bets nobody could have made.

Every event is now checked against the requested date in the engine's
timezone (config.TIMEZONE), and anything from another day is dropped. A 10:30
PM ET kickoff is 02:30 UTC the next day, which is why the comparison uses local
time and not the UTC date. Events with no parseable start time are kept, so a
data quirk can't silently empty a real slate.
