engine/player_props.py
=======================
NFL player props: passing yards, rushing yards, receiving yards, receptions
and QB passing touchdowns. This is the SECOND prop board -- anytime-TD props
live in engine/td_props.py and are ranked separately, because a TD prop and a
receiving-yards prop are not comparable bets and shouldn't compete for slots.

HOW AN EDGE IS FOUND (and why it's shaped this way):

  1. PROJECT the player's number for THIS game:
         base per-game rate  ->  adjusted for the game environment
     The environment adjustment comes from the market itself. The total and
     spread imply how many points each team scores, and that changes volume in
     predictable directions -- a QB in a projected shootout throws more, and a
     RB whose team is favored by two scores runs more in the second half while
     the trailing team's back gets abandoned. Game script is the single
     biggest driver of NFL prop volume and the market hands it to us free.

  2. CONVERT the gap to a probability instead of betting the gap directly.
     Single-game outcomes scatter enormously -- one broken tackle is 40 yards.
     "We project 68 vs a 62.5 line" is NOT a lock; with a 30-yard spread of
     outcomes it's about 57%. We model the result as normal around the
     projection and read the probability off that curve:
         P(over) = 1 - CDF((line - projection) / sigma)
     Skipping this is how prop models convince themselves a 5-yard difference
     is a 90% bet. It's the same discipline that made the HR board's failure
     legible: the model claimed edges the distribution never supported.

  3. COMPARE to the book's implied probability, de-vigged across the two
     sides. Standard -110/-110 pricing implies 52.4% per side, so a real edge
     has to clear the vig, not just 50%.

TWO HARD RULES:
  - MIN GAMES: below config.PLAYER_PROP_MIN_GAMES a per-game average is noise.
    Those players are skipped rather than priced off one big afternoon.
  - NO UNDERS ON QUESTIONABLE PLAYERS (your call). If a questionable player is
    scratched, most books void the bet but some grade it UNDER -- so the bet's
    settlement rules change by book. Overs are unaffected, since a scratch
    just voids them.

The board is a CAP, not a quota: props post only while they clear the edge
bar. A thin slate publishing 4 props is the correct outcome, not a failure.

LABEL CONTRACT (Sep 5, 2026): label_for() is what gets stored in the ledger
AND shown in history, and backtest/grader.py has to be able to read the market,
side and line back out of it to settle the bet. So the format is fixed and
parseable -- "<Name> Over 68.5 Rushing Yards" -- and MARKET_BY_LABEL below is
the reverse lookup the grader uses. Changing the wording of a market_label
breaks grading for every prop already on the ledger; add to MARKET_BY_LABEL
rather than renaming.
