=================
Over/Under (game total) picks -- built for NCAA football, generic enough for
any sport whose records carry points-for / points-against.

HOW THE EDGE IS FOUND (and why this shape):
  1. PROJECT the game's total from both teams' scoring profiles:
         home_expected = (home PPG scored + away PPG allowed) / 2
         away_expected = (away PPG scored + home PPG allowed) / 2
         projected     = home_expected + away_expected
     Averaging each side's offense against the other's defense is the standard
     approach and it self-corrects: a team that has feasted on bad defenses
     gets pulled back toward what its opponent actually allows.

  2. CONVERT the gap to a probability instead of betting the gap directly.
     Final totals scatter widely around their expectation, so "we project 3
     points over the line" is NOT a 100% bet -- with a ~13-point spread of
     outcomes in college football it's barely a 59% one. We model the total as
     normal around the projection and read the probability off that curve:
         P(over) = 1 - CDF((line - projected) / sigma)

  3. COMPARE to the market's implied number. Standard -110 pricing implies
     52.38%, so a real edge has to clear that, not 50%.

LINE SANITY + NO-MOCK GUARD (Sep 4, 2026). Three NCAAF totals were graded as
WINS off lines of 8.0, 7.5 and 8.0 -- baseball run totals, not football ones.
They came from the MOCK odds provider, which fabricates a total in the 7.5-9.5
range whenever the Odds API is out of credits. Every football game clears 8
points, so the model "won" all of them automatically and the totals record was
inflated by picks that were never real bets. Two guards now:

    * a pick is NEVER made off a mock/simulated book -- if the price isn't
      real, there is no market to have an edge against; and
    * the line must fall inside a plausible range for that sport, so a
      wrong-shaped number from any future source is refused rather than bet.

DATA HONESTY: early season there are almost no games stored, so scoring
averages are meaningless. MIN_GAMES_EACH gates that -- with too small a
sample we return no pick rather than a confident-looking guess.
