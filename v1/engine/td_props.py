===================
Anytime-touchdown-scorer props for NFL, the football counterpart to
engine/hr_props.py.

PRESEASON GATE (Aug 27, 2026): TD props are now SKIPPED for preseason games.
Two independent reasons, both decisive:
  1. FanDuel doesn't post anytime-TD markets in preseason at all, so every
     pick came out priced "odds n/a" -- unbettable by definition.
  2. Even if a book did post them, the model would be wrong. lambda is built
     from season TD/game, but preseason starters play a series or two and
     backups take the goal-line work, so a star's season rate has almost no
     bearing on who actually scores. Ranking on it is false confidence.
Games carry is_preseason (set by the schedule provider from ESPN's
seasontype=1); anything flagged preseason is filtered out here.

WHY POISSON INSTEAD OF A POINTS PILE: scoring a TD is a rare count event, the
same shape as hitting a home run, so the honest model is
    P(at least one TD) = 1 - exp(-lambda)
where lambda is the player's expected TDs in THIS game. That gives real
probabilities we can compare against a sportsbook price -- an elite back at
lambda 0.8 comes out ~55%, a rotational WR at 0.15 comes out ~14%, which is
what those props actually pay.

lambda is built from three real inputs:
  1. BASELINE  -- the player's season TD/game (data/nfl_players.get_td_profile;
     falls back to last completed season early in the year).
  2. GAME ENVIRONMENT -- the player's team IMPLIED TOTAL, derived from the
     market's game total and spread. A team projected for 28 points scores far
     more TDs than one projected for 16, and the market tells us that for free.
  3. ROLE -- goal-line backs and target-hog receivers convert opportunity into
     TDs at different rates, so volume nudges lambda.

The 0-100 score is derived FROM the probability (not the reverse), purely so
the board ranks and tiers consistently with the HR board.
