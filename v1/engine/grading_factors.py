"""
engine/grading_factors.py
==========================
One function per grading factor. Each takes a GradingContext and returns an
engine.models.FactorScore (signal -1..+1, + leans HOME).

Reasoning strings name the actual TEAMS instead of "home"/"away".

celestial_signal / numerology_signal arrive already converted to home/away
convention by engine/scoring.py.

FADE-PHASE MOON: on Waxing Gibbous / Full Moon / Waning Gibbous, the
"overvalued favorites become fade material" nights, score_moon_zodiac DOUBLES
its weight so the fade has real teeth against heavy chalk.

FOOTBALL CONTEXT (Aug 22, 2026): score_football_context is the football
equivalent of MLB's pitcher-matchup factor -- rest-day edge, recent-form
trend, and home/away scoring split, all derived from the game_scores table we
already accumulate. It returns a neutral 0 for every non-football sport, and
it says so plainly when NFL results are preseason noise rather than signal.
