=========================
Non-negotiable rules layered on top of raw edge numbers:
  - never below the sport's edge floor (config.min_edge_for(sport))
  - CONVICTION GATE: only picks near the day's best, driven by data
  - PRICE POLICY: no heavy chalk, higher bars on small dogs, MLB favourites,
    and non-MLB long dogs
  - DOG-FIRST ranking on MLB
  - flat 1-unit sizing, up to MAX_PLAYS_PER_DAY plays PER SPORT
  - team diversification, line movement, doubleheader safety

=====================================================================
CONVICTION GATE (Sep 30, 2026) -- one pick is a valid day.
=====================================================================
MAX_PLAYS_PER_DAY was always a CEILING -- nothing ever padded the board. But
the floor it sat on was low: on a 15-game MLB slate, five or more games clear
a 2% edge almost every day, so the board filled to five almost every day and
it LOOKED forced. The picks at the bottom were the ones that barely cleared.

Two extra tests now run before a pick is kept:

  1. RELATIVE STRENGTH. Each pick must carry at least ML_STRONG_PICK_RATIO
     (60%) of the best edge in its sport today. When one game stands well
     above the rest, it publishes alone. When five are genuinely close, five
     publish. The board size is set by the slate, not by the cap.

  2. DATA-DRIVEN. The edge must come mostly from data factors. If moon and
     numerology supply more than ML_MAX_ASTRO_SHARE (50%) of a pick's edge,
     the data alone didn't make the case, and it's dropped.

Honest note: the Sep 30 grade found edge SIZE doesn't separate MLB winners
from losers (winners and losers both averaged 6.96%). So this gate is about
publishing only the model's highest-conviction reads and cutting marginal
volume -- not a promise that high-edge picks win more. Re-grade it once a few
weeks of gated picks exist.

PRICE POLICY (Aug 29, 2026), from 215 graded moneylines:
    big dogs (+150 or longer)   28-30   +44.0u   ROI +75.8%
    favorites (-199..-1)        64-38    +7.0u   ROI  +6.8%
    heavy favs (-200 or worse)  21-6     +0.1u   ROI  +0.4%
    small dogs (+1..+149)       12-16    -2.2u   ROI  -7.8%

CALIBRATION (Sep 30, 2026):
  MLB (324): the model UNDERRATES its dogs -- rated 30-40%, won 59.4%, ROI
  +148%. So MLB ranks dogs first and makes favourites clear 5%.
  Non-MLB (52): the model OVERRATES its dogs -- rated 30-40%, won 22.7%, ROI
  -17%. So other sports need a 4% floor and a 7% edge on +150-or-longer dogs.
